* Problem 6-1
Find strongest connection from u to v with vagueness of k at O(kE + V).
Connection(u, v, k) uses Breath First Search and a hashtable to reach
this time complexity.

Connection(u, v, k):
    define 
        hashtable
        queue
        connection to None

    add u to queue
    set u to 1 at hashtable

    for i=0 to k do
        pop user from left of queue
        for every friend of user do
            append friend to queue

            hashtable[friend] = hashtable[user] * EdgeRank(user, friend)

            if friend is v and
                if connection is None or hashtable[friend] > hashtable[connection] do
                    connection = friend

    return hashtable[connection]
